## About This Project

Quaker.cloud provides accessible, structured documentation to help Friends manage the practical aspects of meeting life—from technology and communications to stewardship and organizational structure. We focus on the operational questions that clerks, committee members, and volunteer administrators encounter, offering guidance that's approachable for Friends who may not consider themselves "tech-savvy."

This project serves as a spiritual successor to the Friends General Conference Quaker Cloud service, which supported meetings from 2011 until December 2023. Rather than hosting websites directly, we focus on documentation and resources that meetings can use regardless of their technical setup.
