## Platform Details

### Zoom

**Best for:** Most meetings, especially those with older or less tech-confident participants

Zoom has become the standard for Quaker virtual worship. Its widespread use means most Friends have encountered it before, reducing the learning curve. The interface is intuitive, and the platform handles varying internet speeds gracefully.

**Key features for worship:**
- Gallery view displays up to 49 participants at once, supporting the sense of gathered meeting
- Phone dial-in included on free accounts, crucial for Friends without internet
- Waiting room lets hosts admit participants, preventing disruption
- "Mute all" and individual mute controls help manage silence
- Stable performance even with many participants

**Limitations:**
- 40-minute limit on free accounts (paid plans start around $150/year)
- Owned by a commercial company with changing privacy policies
- Some Friends have privacy concerns about the platform

**Cost:** Free tier available; Pro plan approximately $150/year

### Google Meet

**Best for:** Meetings already using Google Workspace, or those wanting no software installation

Google Meet runs entirely in a web browser, requiring no downloaded software. This simplifies joining for participants and avoids installation hurdles.

**Key features for worship:**
- No software installation required—works in any modern browser
- Clean, simple interface with fewer options (which can reduce confusion)
- Good integration with Google Calendar for scheduling
- Live captions available
- Strong audio/video quality

**Limitations:**
- Phone dial-in only available on paid Google Workspace plans
- Fewer host controls than Zoom
- Gallery view limited compared to Zoom on some screen sizes
- Requires a Google account to *host* (not to join)

**Cost:** Free tier available; Google Workspace plans start around $6/user/month

---

### Jitsi Meet

**Best for:** Meetings prioritizing privacy and open-source values

Jitsi is free, open-source software that can be used through the public server (meet.jit.si) or self-hosted by a meeting with technical capacity. It aligns with Quaker values around simplicity and avoiding commercial dependencies.

**Key features for worship:**
- Completely free with no time limits
- No account required for anyone (host or participant)
- Open-source software—transparent and community-maintained
- Can be self-hosted for complete control over data
- Simple interface

**Limitations:**
- Less stable with large groups (works best under 20–30 participants)
- Fewer features than commercial platforms
- Gallery view less polished
- Phone dial-in requires additional setup
- Less familiar to most participants, creating a learning curve

**Cost:** Free

### Microsoft Teams

**Best for:** Meetings where participants already use Teams for work

Teams is Microsoft's collaboration platform, widely used in workplaces. If many Friends in your meeting already use Teams professionally, it may feel familiar.

**Key features for worship:**
- Robust platform with good stability
- Strong accessibility features including live captions
- Breakout rooms available
- Together Mode shows participants as if seated in the same room (novelty, but some find it helpful)

**Limitations:**
- Interface is complex, designed for workplace collaboration rather than simple meetings
- Can feel overwhelming for participants unfamiliar with it
- Microsoft account helpful (though not required) to access all features
- Less common in Quaker circles, so less collective knowledge to draw on

**Cost:** Free tier available; paid plans through Microsoft 365

## Features Explained

### Gallery View

Gallery view displays multiple participants in a grid, allowing everyone to see each other simultaneously. This supports the Quaker practice of gathered worship where the community is visible together.

- **Zoom:** Up to 49 participants per screen; can page through additional participants
- **Google Meet:** Up to 49 participants; tiled layout adapts to screen size
- **Jitsi:** Variable; works best with smaller groups
- **Teams:** Up to 49 participants; "Together Mode" offers alternative visualization

### Phone Dial-In

Phone dial-in allows participants to join by calling a phone number, hearing audio without video. This is essential for Friends without internet access, those with unreliable connections, or those who find video technology challenging.

- **Zoom:** Included on all plans, including free
- **Google Meet:** Paid plans only
- **Jitsi:** Requires additional configuration; not available by default
- **Teams:** Available on most plans

### Waiting Room / Lobby

A waiting room holds participants before the host admits them. This prevents disruption from uninvited visitors and allows the host to greet Friends as they arrive.

All four platforms offer this feature, though the implementation varies. Zoom's waiting room is the most refined, allowing hosts to message waiting participants and admit individually or all at once.

### Breakout Rooms

Breakout rooms split participants into smaller groups for conversation, then bring everyone back together. Useful for worship sharing, committee work, or social time after worship.

All four platforms now offer breakout rooms. Zoom's implementation is most mature, allowing pre-assignment of participants and easy movement between rooms.

### Live Captions

Automated captions display spoken words as text, supporting deaf or hard-of-hearing Friends and those who process audio better with visual reinforcement.

- **Zoom:** Built-in live transcription; accuracy varies with speaker clarity
- **Google Meet:** Generally accurate captions; considered among the best
- **Jitsi:** Limited; depends on configuration
- **Teams:** Strong captioning with speaker identification

## Recommendations by Meeting Size

### Small meetings (under 15 participants)
Any platform works well. **Jitsi** is a reasonable choice if privacy matters and you want to avoid commercial platforms. **Zoom** remains easiest for mixed technical abilities.

### Medium meetings (15–50 participants)
**Zoom** or **Google Meet** handle this size comfortably. Zoom's host controls become more valuable as group size increases.

### Large meetings (50+ participants)
**Zoom** is the most reliable choice. Consider a paid plan to remove time limits. Google Meet and Teams can work but may require more attention to settings.

### Meetings with accessibility needs
**Zoom** or **Google Meet** offer the best captioning. Zoom's phone dial-in on free accounts is valuable if any participants lack internet access.

## Privacy Considerations

Some Friends have concerns about commercial platforms collecting data. Brief notes on each:

- **Zoom:** Has improved privacy practices after early criticism; offers end-to-end encryption on some meeting types; data stored on Zoom's servers
- **Google Meet:** Data handled according to Google's privacy policy; integrates with Google's broader data ecosystem
- **Jitsi (meet.jit.si):** Public server has minimal data collection; self-hosting gives complete control
- **Teams:** Data handled according to Microsoft's privacy policy; enterprise-focused security

For meetings where privacy is a primary concern, self-hosted Jitsi offers the most control, though it requires technical capacity to maintain.
