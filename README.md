**Practical documentation and resources for Quaker meetings**

## About This Project

Quaker.cloud provides accessible, structured documentation to help Friends manage the practical aspects of meeting life—from technology and communications to stewardship and organizational structure. The site serves as a complement to existing Quaker resources, focusing specifically on the operational questions that clerks, committee members, and volunteer administrators encounter.

This project emerges as a spiritual successor to the Friends General Conference Quaker Cloud service, which provided website hosting and tools for meetings from 2011 until its discontinuation in December 2023. Rather than hosting websites directly, quaker.cloud focuses on what may be more sustainable: documentation, guidance, and resources that meetings can use regardless of their technical setup.

## Who This Is For

Quaker.cloud is designed for Friends who find themselves responsible for some aspect of meeting operations, often without extensive technical background or formal training:

- **Clerks and recording clerks** seeking guidance on virtual meetings, minute-taking tools, or communication practices
- **Communications committee members** managing websites, newsletters, or social media
- **Treasurers and stewardship committees** looking for practical administrative guidance
- **Technology volunteers** supporting their meeting's digital infrastructure
- **Small meetings and worship groups** working with limited volunteers and resources
- **Anyone curious** about how Quaker values might inform our use of technology

The resources aim to be accessible to Friends who may not consider themselves "tech-savvy" while remaining useful to those with more technical experience.

## What You'll Find Here

### Documentation

The site's primary offering is structured documentation organized around common needs:

- **How-to guides** for specific tasks (setting up a virtual meeting, creating a newsletter, managing a website)
- **Explanations** of concepts and approaches (what makes hybrid worship challenging, how different platforms compare)
- **Reference material** for quick lookup (platform feature comparisons, accessibility checklists)
- **Tutorials** for learning new skills from the ground up

This structure draws inspiration from the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), adapted for a Quaker context rather than technical documentation.

### Essays and Reflections

Beyond practical documentation, the site includes articles exploring questions at the intersection of Quaker faith and contemporary challenges—technology discernment, the role of AI in meeting life, stewardship in a digital age, and related topics viewed through a Quaker lens.

## Relationship to Other Quaker Resources

Quaker.cloud is designed to complement, not compete with, existing resources:

- **[Woodbrooke](https://www.woodbrooke.org.uk/)** offers excellent courses on clerking, eldership, and Quaker practice—we link to these rather than duplicate them
- **[Friends General Conference](https://www.fgcquaker.org/)** provides spiritual deepening resources, QuakerSpeak videos, and the QCCOP peer network
- **[Britain Yearly Meeting](https://www.quaker.org.uk/)** publishes Quaker faith & practice and extensive guidance on meeting roles
- **[Quaker Meetings Network (quaker.app)](https://quaker.app/)** offers website hosting and tools for meetings seeking a managed solution
- **[Western Friend](https://www.westernfriend.org/)** publishes articles, poetry, and reflections from Friends across the western United States

Where these organizations provide resources, we aim to curate and link rather than recreate. Quaker.cloud focuses on gaps—particularly around technology guidance, practical documentation for non-technical Friends, and emerging topics like AI that established organizations haven't yet addressed systematically.
